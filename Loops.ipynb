After the whole code block gets executed, the Python interpreter  will again come to the line `for term in range(0, 10):`. Now this time, second loop gets started, and `term = 1`, and so on, until `term = 9`. After that, our Python interpreter will again come to the `for` loop line, and now it will see that the sequence is exhausted. So, it will exit out of the loop.

We can use the Python inbuilt `len()` function to find out the number of guests in the list, and use it inside `range()` function. The output of `len()` is consistent with `range()`, we ourselves don't have to know the length of the list at all. We are plugging it inside the `range()` function, and `len()` is telling the length of list only to the `range()`, not us. It's all plug and play."

And moreover, we should also check that the condition used in `while` loop don't remains the same forever, because if the condition evaluates to `True` forever, then infinite number of looping cycles will occur, due to which, Python interpreter never exits the loop, and you have to forcibly stop the program to end the loop, without any end result.
