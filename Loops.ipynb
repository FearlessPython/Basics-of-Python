In the first loop, `term = 0`, and then the rest code block below will be executed with the value of `term = 0`. After the whole code block gets executed, the Python interpreter  will again come to the line `for term in range(0, 10):`. Now this time, second loop gets started, and `term = 1`, and so on, until `term = 9`. After that, our Python interpreter will again come to the `for` loop line, and now it will see that the sequence is exhausted. So, it will exit out of the loop. One thing to note is that you can provide any variable in place of `term`, as long as it is meaningful to you.

Suppose there are 6154 guests in our list. Then if we mistakenly use `range(6100)`, then 54 last guests in the list won't be greeted, and they will feel bad. If we use `range(6200)`, then none of the guests will be greeted (it will be an `IndexError`). Oh! How stupid can I be? We can use the Python inbuilt `len()` function to find out the number of guests in the list, and use it inside `range()` function. The output of `len()` is consistent with `range()`, we ourselves don't have to know the length of the list at all. We are plugging it inside the `range()` function, and `len()` is telling the length of list only to the `range()`, not us. It's all plug and play."
